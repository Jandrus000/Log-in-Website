# Overview



This web app is a simple demonstration of a log-in/ sign-up page. This app communicates with FireBase real time database to store users. If users are created or found in the database they are permitted to see the main page.

This purpose of this app was to learn how to use a cloud database and how to implement it using JavaScript. It was also overall practice for JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

# Cloud Database

I am using FireBase real time Database

"users" is the parent item in the database and each child is added with their username being the unique key for each. Each username has the child elements of disliked_movie, favorite_food, name, and password,

# Development Environment

# Future Work

- The database is not secure. If I were to want to keep passwords or any sensitive information I would have to find a way to make the database more secure.
- I want to display user information on the main page. 
- I want to improve the styling of each page
